# Universal Turing machine

The Universal Turing machine is a Turing machine that can simulate any other Turing machine, including itself.

To run an example Turing machine on some input, the following conventions are followed:

- The Universal Turing machine is a 3-tape Turing machine.
- The binary string of the Turing machine to be simulated using the UTM and the input to be simulated are present on the first tape.
- The current state of the machine, if ‘qx’, is denoted by the string of 'x + 1' number of zeros. This is written on the second tape.
- The third tape is used to actually simulate the Turing machine being simulated. This tape initially holds the input to the machine needing simulation.

**Simulation:**

- The Encoding is first validated, if invalid, the machine immediately halts.
- The input from the third tape is read symbol by symbol. Similarly the state is read from the second tape.
- A relevant transition is searched for in the 1st tape, if found, the transition is simulated.
- Changes in the symbol and state are then made.
- Re-do the same until we reach the halting state.
