# Rice’s Theorem & Reductions

**Rice’s theorem** states that any non-trivial property S of Recursively Enumerable languages is undecidable. But what does mean?

- A non-trivial property is one that is neither true nor false for all languages. Some languages may have that particular property and others may not.
    - Example: The given language is Recursive. Some are, some aren’t. Hence non-trivial.
- Undecidability of these languages is asserted by the fact that it cannot be stated with certainty that the language is decidable if the property itself is either not true for all languages or not false for all languages.

### Reductions:

Once it was proved that the Halting problem is undecidable, mathematicians used the concept of reductions to reduce instances of the Halting problem to instances of the problem being tested for decidability to prove if that problem is decidable or not. To the naive reader it may seem counter-intuitive to reduce the Halting problem to another problem instead of the other way around, but note that we’re trying to
