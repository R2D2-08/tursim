# RE and Recursive languages

Recall the definition of a language (link to pre-requisites), i.e., simply a set of strings.

> Only the formal definitions are given here, their practical usage will be discussed in the decidability chapter.

### **Recursively Enumerable Languages:**

For a given Turing machine ‘M’, if it isn’t certain that the machine ‘M’ will halt on any input string ‘x’ which is a part of a language ‘L’, then we say that L is a recursively enumerable language. For strings that the machine will not halt, it will loop forever.

### Recursive Languages:

For a given Turing machine ‘M’, if it is known with utmost certainty that the machine ‘M’ will halt on any input string ‘x’ which is a part of a language ‘L’, then we say that L is a recursive language. (aka a recursive set)

### 3 Classes of Languages:

1. Recursive languages
2. Languages that are RE but not recursive
3. non-RE languages

### Properties of Recursive sets and RE sets:

1. The union of 2 recursive sets is recursive.
2. The union of 2 RE sets is RE.
3. The complement of a recursive set is recursive.
4. If L and L complement are RE, then L is recursive.
