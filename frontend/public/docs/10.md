# Encoding of a Turing machine

A standard Turing machine operates over a binary string using a transition function defined over a finite set of states. Is it possible to encode a Turing machine as a binary string using a set of rules? Turns out, it is, and the same concept can be used to prove the undecidability of the Halting problem.

### Encoding a Turing machine:

The following are the conventions and the rules adhered to when encoding a Turing machine M = (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q1, B, F) with:

`Q = {q1, · · · , qn}`

`Σ = {0, 1}`

`Γ = {0, 1, B}`

`q1 = initial state`

`Transition function : δ(qi, Xj) = (qk, Xl, L/R)`

1. Each transition in the transition function is encoded as the following binary string: (0^i)1(0^j)1(0^k)1(0^l)1(0^m).
2. Every transition is separated from the other one by using '11'. 'm11n11o11p' where m, n, o, p are binary strings encoding distinct transitions.
3. The value of 'i' and 'k' should be between 1 and n (total number of states).
4. X1 = 0, X2 = 1, X3 = B | The value of 'j' and 'l' should be between 1 and 3.
5. A move to the left can be encoded as one 0 and a move to the right can be encoded as two 0's.
6. Each transition is distinguished from the other using ‘11’.
7. ‘111’ is used to mark the end of the encoding of a Turing machine.

**Example:**

Encoding = 11101001000101001100010101001001100010010010100110001000100010010111

The above encoding is for the machine M = ({q1, q2, q3}, {0, 1}, {0, 1, B}, δ, q1, B, {q2}) with δ:

1. δ(q1, 1) = (q3, 0, R)
2. δ(q3, 0) = (q1, 1, R)
3. δ(q3, 1) = (q2, 0, R)
4. δ(q3, B) = (q3, 1, L)
