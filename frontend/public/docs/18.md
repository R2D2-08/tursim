# Modified Post Correspondence problem

An instance of the modified post correspondence’s problem (PCP) consists of the same 2 lists of strings over some alphabet. Given that the 2 lists are of equal length, can you produce a combination of strings from both lists such that the concatenated strings in either list result in the same concatenated string with an additional constraint that forces the combination from both the lists to always start with the first sub-string in either list?

If list A = w1, w2, w3…wk & list B = x1, x2, x3…xk for some k, we say that there exists a solution to the PCP problem for lists A and B if:

- There exists a sequence of one or more integers i1, i2, i3….im when interpreted as indices for strings in lists A and B, result in the same string. i.e. w1 wi1 wi2 · · · wim = x1 xi1 xi2 · · · xim
- The sequence of indices: 1, i1, i2, i3….im is the solution to this instance of the PCP problem.

To prove the undecidability of the PCP problem, we first prove the undecidability of the MPCP problem.
