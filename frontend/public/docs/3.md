# Turing Machines

A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that simulates any algorithm. It's defined by an infinite tape, a read/write head, a finite set of states, and a transition function that dictates how the machine operates.

### Mathematical Definition of a Turing machine:

A Turing machine can be formally described as a 7-tuple (Q, X, ∑, δ, q0, B, F), where:

- Q is a finite set of states
- X is the tape alphabet
- ∑ is the input alphabet
- δ is a transition function; δ : Q × X → Q × X × {L, R}.
- q0 is the initial state
- B is the blank symbol
- F is the set of final states

### Components of a Turing machine:

1. Infinite Tape: A tape divided into cells, each holding a symbol.
2. Tape Head: Reads and writes symbols on the tape and can move left or right.
3. Finite Set of States: A finite number of states the machine can be in.
4. Transition Function: A set of rules that determines the machine's next action (read/write a symbol, move the head, change state) based on the current state and symbol read.

### How it Works:

1. The machine starts in an initial state with input symbols on the tape.
2. The tape head reads the symbol at the start of the tape.
3. The transition function determines the next action based on the current state and the symbol it has read.
4. This process repeats, with the machine changing its state, writing to the tape, and moving the head, until it halts in a final state.
