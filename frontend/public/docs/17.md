# Post Correspondence’s problem

An instance of the post correspondence’s problem (PCP) consists of 2 lists of strings over some alphabet. Given that the 2 lists are of equal length, can you produce a combination of strings from both lists such that the concatenated strings in either list result in the same concatenated string?

If list A = w1, w2, w3…wk & list B = x1, x2, x3…xk for some k, we say that there exists a solution to the PCP problem for list A and B if:

- There exists a sequence of one or more integers i1, i2, i3….im when interpreted as indices for strings in lists A and B, result in the same string. i.e.  wi1 wi2 · · · wim = xi1 xi2 · · · xim
- The sequence i1, i2, i3….im is the solution to this instance of the PCP problem.
